- ** Branch: ** A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository but does not affect the primary branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.
- ** Clone: **
